recents entry, add (Recording) when recording

RecordingServiceManager

what happens if i start foreground service before activity onStop??
will a notification flash?


remove hilt dependency


floating timer, i can use lifecycleScope instead of my own scope???
not sure as setContent { composable } might be on the wrong thread dispatcher???

how to cancel workout from the ongoing notification? (codelab)

does my service need to deal with configuration changes
  say change font size in settings or something
  onbind will be called a second time
