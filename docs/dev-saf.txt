#doitwrong
recents entry, add (Recording) when recording

RecordingServiceManager

what happens if i start foreground service before activity onStop??
will a notification flash?


remove hilt dependency


floating timer, i can use lifecycleScope instead of my own scope???
not sure as setContent { composable } might be on the wrong thread dispatcher???

how to cancel workout from the ongoing notification? (codelab)

does my service need to deal with configuration changes
  say change font size in settings or something
  onbind will be called a second time


do i just copy the codelab way of doing things....
or do i do it another way???
yes


don't use unbind
when recording starts
  startForeground
when recording stops
  stopForground
when vm oncleared
  if ! recording
    service.stopSelf

prompt for notification permission on startup
  launchedEffect, run every time
  see if it passes play store console review
