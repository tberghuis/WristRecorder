  cannot access 'BoxScopeInstance': it is internal in 'androidx.compose.foundation.layout'

future
  replace AudioTrack with exoplayer so i get better api for progressbar


https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=android%20AudioTrack%20answers%3a1..

keep app from timing out when recording (keep screen / activity on / running)

app is really laggy

when recording show an incrementing counting timer in UI

new siging key named voice-memos, delete wear-recorder
  or rename app


marketing reddit, wearosdev and wearos subs

playback show progress (5/25 seconds)

use exoplayer instead of audiotrack

auto record delay setting,
  show countdown on activity launch

physical button start/stop recording

compatible device list? check if watch has speaker and mic

add hardware button start/stop recording to marketing
